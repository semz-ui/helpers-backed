Dear Hiring Team at Spotify,

I am excited to apply for the Frontend Developer Internship at Spotify. With four years of experience in frontend development and a strong foundation in creating user-friendly, high-performance web applications, I am eager to contribute to Spotify’s mission of building impactful SaaS solutions. Spotify’s reputation for innovation and excellence makes this opportunity especially compelling to me.

In my previous role at TaxTech, I led the development of TPay, a responsive fintech platform that improved salary reimbursement efficiency and reduced transactional errors. This experience allowed me to deepen my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while ensuring optimal performance and scalability. Additionally, I collaborated on Datasek, a full-stack project leveraging Laravel for the backend and React for the frontend. This cross-functional experience strengthened my adaptability, problem-solving skills, and ability to quickly learn new frameworks.

What excites me most about Spotify is your startup culture and focus on delivering meaningful solutions to customers. I thrive in agile, collaborative environments and am confident in my ability to bring both technical skills and a proactive mindset to your team. My dedication to clean, efficient code and creating seamless user experiences aligns closely with Spotify’s values and goals.

I would be thrilled to further discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to the success of Spotify’s projects. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to interview and share how I can add value to your team.
